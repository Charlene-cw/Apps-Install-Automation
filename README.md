# Apps-Install-Automation
This batch script automates the installation of multiple applications for quick, hands-free setup. 

To ensure all installers run correctly, the script must be executed as an administrator, as some apps require elevated privileges and will silently fail otherwise. Installer file names referenced in the script must match exactly with those in file explorer, and the config.xml file used for Office 365 installation should be placed inside the Apps_installers subfolder with the other installers.
